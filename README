This is Perl module CMS::Lite.

WARNINGS
    This is considered as alpha quality software. Most of the stuff are
    undocumented since it's considered unstable and will likely to change.
    You should sometimes look at the source code or example apps in *eg*
    directory to see how this thing works.
    
    And this module is my personal project. So may change without prior notice...

    It allows yout to generate xhtml only to write text formatted Text::Trac, Text::Hatena, or simular formatt text.
